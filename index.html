            <p>This graph illustrates the male vs female entries in A Level Mathematics over the years. From this perspective, 
                it looks like they rise and fall together - allowing us to track broader impacts e.g. government policy, 
                how accessible the GCSE maths exam was the year before entry, etc.</p>
            
            <img src="percentage_maths.png" alt="Percentage of Females Choosing Maths A Level">
            <p>This graph shows the percentage of female students choosing A Level Mathematics, as a percentage of the total number
                of students. This gives us a clearer understanding of how these broader changes impacted girls uptake of maths.
                For example, the difficult GCSE maths paper in June 2018 seems to have impacted girls' uptake of maths A level
                more than it effected boys', although they were both lower. At the same time, it is worth noting that we are
                now moving within just 2 percentage points over the course of these 8 academic years. This suggests a stability
                to the proportion of girls choosing A level maths. </p>
