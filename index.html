            <img src="gender_maths.png" alt="Male vs Female A Level Maths Entries">
            <p>This graph illustrates the male vs female entries in A Level Mathematics over the years. From this perspective, 
                it looks like they rise and fall together - allowing us to track broader impacts e.g. government policy, 
                how accessible the GCSE maths exam was the year before entry, etc.</p>
            
            <img src="percentage_maths.png" alt="Percentage of Females Choosing Maths A Level">
            <p>This graph shows the percentage of female students choosing A Level Mathematics, as a percentage of the total number
                of students. This gives us a clearer understanding of how these broader changes impacted girls uptake of maths.
                For example, the difficult GCSE maths paper in June 2018 seems to have impacted girls' uptake of maths A level
                more than it effected boys', although they were both lower. At the same time, it is worth noting that we are
                now moving within just 2 percentage points over the course of these 8 academic years. This suggests a stability
                to the proportion of girls choosing A level maths. </p>

        <!-- Section for A Level Further Mathematics -->
        <section>
            <h2>A Level Further Mathematics</h2>
            <img src="gender_fmaths.png" alt="Male vs Female A Level Further Maths Entries">
            <p>This graph displays the male vs female entries in A Level Further Mathematics. Again we can see the two groups 
                broadly tracking together. We see the impact of the difficult GCSE exam in 2018.</p>
            
            <img src="percentage_fmaths.png" alt="Percentage of Females Choosing Further Maths A Level">
            <p>This graph represents the percentage of female students choosing A Level Further Mathematics. We are moving 
            within less than 2 percentage points over the 8 years, which is even more significant as the number of entries 
            is lower in this subject. This indicates stability in the proportion of girls choosing A level further maths.
            We can see again that a difficult GCSE maths exam impacts girls' confidence in choosing A level further maths
            more than boys'. </p>
